Version history for MooseX::Method::Signatures

0.36  Tue, 31 Aug 2010 23:36:19 +0200
  * Avoid deprecation warnings from new Moose version by depending on
    MooseX::LazyRequire 0.06 (Jeremy Carman).

0.35  Mon, 19 Jul 2010 05:50:08 +0200
  * Updated to avoid warnings from Moose 1.09 (Dave Rolsky).
  * Switch from Module::Install to Dist::Zilla.

0.34  Tue, 08 Jun 2010 14:00:00 -0300
  * Provides a version of reify that replaces the original version and
    now finally CatalystX::Declare and MooseX::MultiMethods work.

0.33  Thu, 01 Jun 2010 13:47:34 -0300
  * CatalystX::Declare seems to create a method object without a code
    reference at all.

0.32  Thu, 01 Jun 2010 13:47:34 -0300
  * Detect usage of old MXMS::Meta::Method API and retro-compatibilize.

0.31  Thu, 01 Jun 2010 13:47:34 -0300
  * Add support for "does" as a trait declarator
  * Compatibilize MXMS::Meta::Method signature with Class::MOP::Method
    so other traits can apply customizations to the actual body of the
    method.

0.30  Thu, 04 Feb 2010 02:41:36 +0100
  * Make Any instead of Defined the default type constraint.
  * Add tests for coercing optional named parameters (Cory Watson).
    + Make those tests pass by depending on
      MooseX::Types::Structured 0.20.
  * Make sure Text::Balanced doesn't screw up our data.

0.29  Thu, 15 Oct 2009 23:27:08 +0200
  * Fix regression introduced in 0.28.
    Validation for methods without named arguments wasn't strict enough
    anymore. Passing too many arguments hasn't been rejected. Thanks
    Justin Hunter for finding this.

0.28  Fri, 09 Oct 2009 01:28:02 +0200
  * Fix default values for named arguments.

0.27  Tue, 22 Sep 2009 14:30:23 +0200
  * Depend on MooseX::LazyRequire 0.04 to avoid fail on version 0.03, which has
    been broken by recent Moose versions (Closes RT#49903) (Maik Hentsche).

0.26  Tue, 08 Sep 2009 19:14:01 +0100
  * Rebuilt dist to include missing files

0.25  Mon, 07 Sep 2009 22:003:03 +0100
  * Remove scary ALPHA disclaimer from POD
  * Depend on Test::More 0.88 for done_testing

0.24  Mon, 31 Aug 2009 19:04:14 +0200
  * Rename the meta method's clone method to reify. clone already had a special
    meaning for methods in role applications to classes.

0.23  Thu, 27 Aug 2009 22:22:40 +0200
  * Bump Moose dependency to 0.89. This avoids test failures on some older
    Moose versions.

0.22  Thu, 27 Aug 2009 15:29:25 +0200
  * Provide sane closure behaviour for anonymous methods.
  * Add tests for the above (Sebastian Willert).
  * Depend on MooseX::Types 0.19, as 0.18 made us blow up spectacularly.

0.21  Tue, 18 Aug 2009 08:45:48 +0200
  * Add tests for using aliased.pm for type aliases (Steffen Schwigon).
  * Depend on the latest PMS to get type alias resolving.

0.20  Mon, 17 Aug 2009 12:11:32 +0200
  * Make the meta method's parsed_signature public.
  * Use MooseX::LazyRequire's new interface and depend on 0.03.

0.19  Fri, 14 Aug 2009 11:23:42 +0200
  * Move method redefinition warnings to the method application hook so it's
    easy to override.

0.18  Fri, 14 Aug 2009 02:24:41 +0200
  * Depend on Devel::Declare 0.005011. This avoids "->method" and "method =>"
    being misinterpreted sometimes.

0.17  Thu, 13 Aug 2009 08:37:31 +0200
  * Implement method traits (Cory Watson).
  * Properly test list placeholders.
  * Document the right syntax for return value type constraints.
  * Use namespace::autoclean instead of namespace::clean.
  * Let the signature default to (@) if none is given.
  * Don't require the package attribute when a pre-built context is passed
    in.
  * Depend on a recent Parse::Method::Signatures to make sure we will work
    with new PPIs and have the right MooseX::Traits version.
  * Fix doc typo (arcanez).
  * Split out context from self so that we may pass in an arbitrary context
    (nperez).
  * Enable passing a context and also a coderef to use to apply the method
    once constructed (for deferred method modifier application in MXD)
    (nperez).
  * Enable MXMS to work with multiple different declarators and prototype
    injections (nperez).
  * Change from using Devel::Declare::MethodInstaller::Simple to
    ::Context::Simple since strip_attrs was moved down there (nperez).

0.16  Fri, 01 May 2009 08:03:44 +0200
  * Bump prereq to Types::Structured to avoid warnings on new Moose versions.
  * Make sure the method keyword is "tight" enough, so
    "@methods = (method { }, method { });" works.
  * Implement non-scalar parameters.
  * Updated documentation.
  * Fix a couple of POD nits (Matt Kraai).

0.15  Mon, 13 Apr 2009 04:32:25 +0200
  * Use MooseX::Meta::TypeConstraint::ForceCoercion instead of forcing coercion
    manually on validation to make reusing the method type constraints easier.

0.14  Wed, 08 Apr 2009 03:45:50 +0200
  * Depend on MooseX::Types::Structured 0.11. 0.10 had a bug which caused
    validation to always fail.

0.13  Sat, 28 Mar 2009 13:04:36 +0000
  * Fix bug with namespace::clean and MooseX::Types. (Ash Berlin)
  * Rename methods to remove __ANON__ from callstack.
  * Port to using 'from_namespace' from Parse::Method::Signatures 1.003003.
  * Ensure errors from type constraints are reporting from the right place.
  * Now warns if you try to refdefine a method.
  * Return values can now be enforced by using

      method foo ($x) returns (ArrayRef) { }

    This will be documented in the pod once we are happy with the exact
    behaviour. See t/return_value.t for examples for now.
  * Depend upon Parse::Method::Signatures 1.003004 for better error reporting
  * Fix a bug in methods with attributes on perl 5.8.7
  * Fix bug in location of errors with older Mooses
  * Bump minium Moose dep to 0.63

0.12  Wed, 04 Mar 2009 03:05:19 +0100
  * Implement and test scalar placeholder values.
  * Eval default value so reference and string defaults work as expected.
  * Make the testsuite less noisy.

0.11  Tue, 03 Mar 2009 03:27:00 +0100
  * Use MooseX::Types introspection capabilities instead of blindly executing
    functions in other pakages.
  * Stop mentioning the deprecated MX::Method, as requested by its author.
  * Fix and test reporting of compile-time error message (Ash Berlin).
  * Small stylistic whitespace changes in the docs.
  * Test that optional params really are optional (Rhesa Rozendaal).
  * Added test for hashref default values (Rhesa Rozendaal).
  * Testing that eval works with semicolon insertion (Hakim Cassimally).

0.10  Sat, 28 Feb 2009 19:04:02 +0100

    interpolations.

0.09  Mon, 23 Feb 2009 08:07:47 +0100
  * Port to MX::Types::Structured.
    + Much more useful error messages, including backtraces.
    + Don't pass undef for parameters now actual value was provided for.
  * Require a Defined value, not a simple Value when no type constraints are
    given.

  * Use Moose meta methods instead of just coderefs.
