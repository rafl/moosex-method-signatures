Version history for MooseX::Method::Signatures

0.15  Mon, 13 Apr 2009 04:32:25 +0200
  * Use MooseX::Meta::TypeConstraint::ForceCoercion instead of forcing coercion
    manually on validation to make reusing the method type constraints easier.

0.14  Wed, 08 Apr 2009 03:45:50 +0200
  * Depend on MooseX::Types::Structured 0.11. 0.10 had a bug which caused
    validation to always fail.

0.13  Sat, 28 Mar 2009 13:04:36 +0000
  * Fix bug with namespace::clean and MooseX::Types. (Ash Berlin)
  * Rename methods to remove __ANON__ from callstack.
  * Port to using 'from_namespace' from Parse::Method::Signatures 1.003003.
  * Ensure errors from type constraints are reporting from the right place.
  * Now warns if you try to refdefine a method.
  * Return values can now be enforced by using

      method foo ($x) returns (ArrayRef) { }

    This will be documented in the pod once we are happy with the exact
    behaviour. See t/return_value.t for examples for now.
  * Depend upon Parse::Method::Signatures 1.003004 for better error reporting
