Version history for MooseX::Method::Signatures

0.24  Mon, 31 Aug 2009 19:04:14 +0200
  * Rename the meta method's clone method to reify. clone already had a special
    meaning for methods in role applications to classes.

0.23  Thu, 27 Aug 2009 22:22:40 +0200
  * Bump Moose dependency to 0.89. This avoids test failures on some older
    Moose versions.

0.22  Thu, 27 Aug 2009 15:29:25 +0200
  * Provide sane closure behaviour for anonymous methods.
  * Add tests for the above (Sebastian Willert).
  * Depend on MooseX::Types 0.19, as 0.18 made us blow up spectacularly.

0.21  Tue, 18 Aug 2009 08:45:48 +0200
  * Add tests for using aliased.pm for type aliases (Steffen Schwigon).
  * Depend on the latest PMS to get type alias resolving.

0.20  Mon, 17 Aug 2009 12:11:32 +0200
  * Make the meta method's parsed_signature public.
  * Use MooseX::LazyRequire's new interface and depend on 0.03.

0.19  Fri, 14 Aug 2009 11:23:42 +0200
  * Move method redefinition warnings to the method application hook so it's
    easy to override.

0.18  Fri, 14 Aug 2009 02:24:41 +0200
  * Depend on Devel::Declare 0.005011. This avoids "->method" and "method =>"
    being misinterpreted sometimes.

0.17  Thu, 13 Aug 2009 08:37:31 +0200
  * Implement method traits (Cory Watson).
  * Properly test list placeholders.
  * Document the right syntax for return value type constraints.
  * Use namespace::autoclean instead of namespace::clean.
  * Let the signature default to (@) if none is given.
  * Don't require the package attribute when a pre-built context is passed
    in.
  * Depend on a recent Parse::Method::Signatures to make sure we will work
    with new PPIs and have the right MooseX::Traits version.
  * Fix doc typo (arcanez).
  * Split out context from self so that we may pass in an arbitrary context
    (nperez).
  * Enable passing a context and also a coderef to use to apply the method
    once constructed (for deferred method modifier application in MXD)
    (nperez).
  * Enable MXMS to work with multiple different declarators and prototype
    injections (nperez).
  * Change from using Devel::Declare::MethodInstaller::Simple to
    ::Context::Simple since strip_attrs was moved down there (nperez).

0.16  Fri, 01 May 2009 08:03:44 +0200
  * Bump prereq to Types::Structured to avoid warnings on new Moose versions.
  * Make sure the method keyword is "tight" enough, so
    "@methods = (method { }, method { });" works.
  * Implement non-scalar parameters.
  * Updated documentation.
  * Fix a couple of POD nits (Matt Kraai).

0.15  Mon, 13 Apr 2009 04:32:25 +0200
  * Use MooseX::Meta::TypeConstraint::ForceCoercion instead of forcing coercion
    manually on validation to make reusing the method type constraints easier.

0.14  Wed, 08 Apr 2009 03:45:50 +0200
  * Depend on MooseX::Types::Structured 0.11. 0.10 had a bug which caused
    validation to always fail.

0.13  Sat, 28 Mar 2009 13:04:36 +0000
  * Fix bug with namespace::clean and MooseX::Types. (Ash Berlin)
  * Rename methods to remove __ANON__ from callstack.
  * Port to using 'from_namespace' from Parse::Method::Signatures 1.003003.
  * Ensure errors from type constraints are reporting from the right place.
  * Now warns if you try to refdefine a method.
  * Return values can now be enforced by using

      method foo ($x) returns (ArrayRef) { }

    This will be documented in the pod once we are happy with the exact
    behaviour. See t/return_value.t for examples for now.
  * Depend upon Parse::Method::Signatures 1.003004 for better error reporting
  * Fix a bug in methods with attributes on perl 5.8.7
  * Fix bug in location of errors with older Mooses
  * Bump minium Moose dep to 0.63

0.12  Wed, 04 Mar 2009 03:05:19 +0100
  * Implement and test scalar placeholder values.
  * Eval default value so reference and string defaults work as expected.
  * Make the testsuite less noisy.

0.11  Tue, 03 Mar 2009 03:27:00 +0100
  * Use MooseX::Types introspection capabilities instead of blindly executing
    functions in other pakages.
  * Stop mentioning the deprecated MX::Method, as requested by its author.
  * Fix and test reporting of compile-time error message (Ash Berlin).
  * Small stylistic whitespace changes in the docs.
  * Test that optional params really are optional (Rhesa Rozendaal).
  * Added test for hashref default values (Rhesa Rozendaal).
  * Testing that eval works with semicolon insertion (Hakim Cassimally).

0.10  Sat, 28 Feb 2009 19:04:02 +0100
  * Mention all contributors.
  * Update copyright notice for 2009.
  * Refer to Method::Signatures::Simple.
  * Move most of the actual functionality into the method metaclass.
  * Allow adding methods with signature validation without the
    Devel::Declare sugar.

    interpolations.

0.09  Mon, 23 Feb 2009 08:07:47 +0100
  * Port to MX::Types::Structured.
    + Much more useful error messages, including backtraces.
    + Don't pass undef for parameters now actual value was provided for.
  * Require a Defined value, not a simple Value when no type constraints are
    given.
  * Add more tests. Improve existing tests.

0.08  Sun, 22 Feb 2009 02:15:40 +0100

  * Explain interaction with Role's 'require' (Yanick Champoux).

0.06  Tue, 14 Oct 2008 05:43:35 +0200
  * Use Moose meta methods instead of just coderefs.
